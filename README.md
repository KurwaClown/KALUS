# KALUS


KALUS stands for KurwaClown Application for League of Legends Unconcerned Summoners. 

It is designed to enhance the League client experience by automating various actions within the game client. With KALUS, players can streamline processes such as champion selection, rune and summoner spell setup, and much more.

## Main Features

- **Automated Actions**: KALUS allows players to automate several actions in the League of Legends game client, saving time and effort. Key features include:

  - Getting Ready on Match Found: Automatically handle the process of getting ready when a match is found, ensuring you never miss the ready check even when you're away from your computer.
  - Champion Pick and Ban: Easily select and arrange champions you want to pick or ban for champion selection.
  - Aram Swap : Automatically swap for the champions you prefer in Aram. It is faster than other user and also is not affected by swap cooldowns.
  - Rune and Summoner Spells Configuration: Automatically sets your runes and summoner spells based on League of Legends' recommended choices.

- **Randomize Skins**: Enhance your in-game experience by randomizing the skin you use for your character with just a click of a button or on champion pick.

- **Minimal Internet Usage**: KALUS only sends requests to the internet for retrieving basic information about champions during startup, and for rune recommendations or image assets when they are not available from the client data.

6. KALUS will automatically detect the game client and act accordingly based on your configured settings and preferences.
